# Meeting Minutes - January 30th, 2026

## Sprint 1 Planning

- The team created user stories for Sprint 1, defining the core features and functionality to be implemented.
- We assessed the priority of each user story and task to determine the order of development.
- Team members were assigned to specific tasks based on their skills and availability.

## Repository Organization

- We reorganized the folder structure in the repository to improve clarity and maintainability.
- Source code was moved into the `src/` directory to separate it from configuration files.
- Meeting minutes were documented and added to the `Sprints/` folder.

## Documentation and Tracking

- We created a contribution log to track each member's activity, including timestamps and time spent on tasks.
- This will help ensure accountability and provide visibility into the team's progress throughout the sprint.
